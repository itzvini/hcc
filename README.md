# HCC Player Council

Static Highrise Creature Club Player Council announcement site, packaged with a tiny Node server for Railway.

## Local Run

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

For local dev with live market data, put your key in `.env` and run `npm run dev`:

```
OPENSEA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Market data

The **Market** tab shows floor prices and weekly sale-price history for Creatures and LAND.

- **Creatures** — floor + sale history from the Immutable zkEVM API (no key required).
- **LAND** — floor + 30-day stats + sale history from OpenSea when `OPENSEA_API_KEY` is set.
  Without a key it falls back to CoinGecko for the current floor only (no history line).

All data is fetched server-side and cached for 30 minutes (`/api/market`), so no
database is needed — history is recomputed from on-chain/marketplace sales each refresh.

## Railway

Railway can deploy this repo directly. The app listens on `process.env.PORT` and serves `index.html`.

To get the LAND history line in production, add `OPENSEA_API_KEY` to the Railway service's
**Variables** (the local `.env` is gitignored and not deployed). Without it, LAND still shows
its current floor via CoinGecko.
